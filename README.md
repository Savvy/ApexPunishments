# ApexPunishments
A superior punishment system by ApexCreations

## TODO
- Other persistant options, including but not limited to noSQL, and flatfile.
- More commands such as /history, /ipban and /lockdown.
- Allow for time extensions in another ban/mute command.
- ~~Multiple punishments can be applied at the same time~~
- ~~All messages configurable including the prefix~~
- ~~Persistant punishments (mySQL, others coming soon.)~~
- ~~Tables create themselves automatically for easy plug and go~~
- ~~Aikar db integration which means quicker saving to SQL.~~
- ~~Concurrent durations (If one runs out, then the other one will continue)~~
- Allow for Punishment's durations to overriden
- Implement Event's API
- Implement Commands
